Solve ---- solves an equation or a systems of equations or inequalities for
           some variables

Reduce ---- more methods than Solve, gives conditional statements

NSolve ---- numerically solves an equation or system of equations or inequalities for
            some variables

Minimize ---- minimize a function with constrains (even over regions)

Maximize ---- same as Minimize albeit it maximises a function 

NMinimize ---- numerical version of Minimize

NMaximize ---- numerical version of Maximize

FindRoot ---- searches numerically for the root of a function or simultaneously for
              functions

DSolve ---- solves differential eqn(s) (odes/pdes) / even over some region

DSolveValue ---- outputs the value of DSolve

NDSolve ---- numerical solver for differential eqn(s) (odes/pdes) / even over some
             region

NDSolveValue ---- outputs the value of NDSolve

ParametricNDSolve ---- just like NDSolve but you can include a parameter to sweep
                       its effects

ParametricNDSolveValue ---- outputs the value of ParametricNDSolveValue
